# Deep-Learning-Papers
A collection of the current papers I have read in deep learning, as of now, I am inspired by papers in spiking neural networks 
(SNNs), meta-learning and self-pruning networks.

# Wide-Impact Papers
*Attention is all you need* 


# Meta-Learning
[Meta-Learning in Neural Networks: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05439) (Timothy Hospedales, Antreas Antoniou, Paul Micaelli, Amos Storkey)

Hospedales et. al describe Meta-learning as a potential candidate to combat the data inefficiencies, poor knowledge transfer 
and unsupervised learning aspects of DNNs in research at the moment. There are different interpretations of the phrase 'meta-
learning' but the paper focuses on **contemporary *neural network* meta-learning**. Meaning "algorithm learning, but focus 
on where this is achieved by end-to-end learning of an explicitly defined objective function (such as cross-entropy loss)".
